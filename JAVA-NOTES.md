## Summary of Effective Java 
* Classes and Interfaces <br>
      1. Minimize the accessibility of classes and members (Use of Encapsulation) <br>
      2. In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields <br>
      3. Minimize mutability (Don’t provide methods that modify the object’s state, Ensure that the class can’t be extended, Make all fields final, Make all fields private and Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components)<br>
      4. Favor composition over inheritance <br>
      5. Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it <br>
      6. Prefer interfaces to abstract classes <br>
      7. Design interfaces for posterity <br>
      8. Use interfaces only to define types <br>
      9. Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes <br>
      10. Favor static member classes over nonstatic <br>
