# Programming Interviews
## Resources 
 *  Our favorite Java reference is Peter Sestoft's "Java Precisely".
 *  The definitive book for Java is "Java: TheCompleteReference" by Oracle 
 *  Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java" 
 *   For design patterns, we like "Head First Design Patterns" by Freeman et al
 *   Tony Bevis "Java Design Pattern Essentials" 
 *   "Java Concurrency in Practice", by Goetz et al. 
 *   Elements of Programming Interviews in Java by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash
## Purpose: Write elegant and fast algorithm based on performance of Data Structures, Time complexity and Tests of edge & corner cases 

- The ability to rigorously formulate real-world problems.
- The skills to solve problems and design algorithms.
- The tools to go from an algorithm to a tested program.
- The analytical techniques required to determine the computational complexity
of your solution

## Solution: Brute-force -> Analyze -> Improve 
 * Designed solutions are expected to be a detailed solution on a whiteboard or paper: Think out loud and use patterns
 * Skills: Learn to COMMUINCATE a complex idea to the team with concrete examples, Passion for learning new stack, grasp DSA and System Design
     
      1. Focus on to-level algorithm by using abstraction, use libraries and TODO comments for functions not yet implemented
      2. Write unit tests: Assume valid inputs and test corner/edge cases [nonnegative integers, empty array, one element, possible overflow ...]
      3. Techniques: Sorting, Recursion, Divide-and-Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy algorithms, Invariants
