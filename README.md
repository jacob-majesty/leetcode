# Leetcode
## Purpose: Write elegant and fast algorithm based on performance of Data Structures, Time complexity and Tests of edge & corner cases 

- The ability to rigorously formulate real-world problems.
- The skills to solve problems and design algorithms.
- The tools to go from an algorithm to a tested program.
- The analytical techniques required to determine the computational complexity
of your solution

## Solution: Brute-force -> Analyze -> Improve 
 * Designed solutions are expected to be a detailed solution on a whiteboard or paper
